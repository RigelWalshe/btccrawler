# btccrawler
Basic web based bitcoin node archiver.  Designed to help me simultaneously learn Django and experiment with python commands involved in performing the network version handshake that I earned in the bitcoin corps course.  VERY embryonic at the moment and only really on github so I can also practice working on a project using Github.  Currently online at  http://btccrawler2-env.abmp4evcvx.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Note-
At present there is no user feedback when you start the node from the homepage (will incorporate this next using Celery). just click the start button and check the results after a few minutes.
